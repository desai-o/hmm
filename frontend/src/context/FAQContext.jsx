    excerpt: "I'm a sophomore CS student and want to break into AI/ML. What's the best structured roadmap to follow in 2026?",
    description: "I'm a sophomore CS student and want to break into AI/ML. I've taken basic courses in Python and statistics, but I'm unsure about the best path forward. Should I focus on deep learning frameworks first, or build a stronger math foundation? What projects should I work on? What are the must-read papers? I'd appreciate any structured roadmap or advice from people who've made this transition successfully.",

        content: "Great question! Here's the roadmap I recommend: 1) Start with Andrew Ng's ML course on Coursera. 2) Learn PyTorch — it's the industry standard now. 3) Build 3-4 projects: image classification, NLP sentiment analysis, a recommendation system. 4) Read the 'Attention Is All You Need' paper. 5) Start contributing to open-source ML projects. The key is consistency — spend 2-3 hours daily and you'll see progress within 6 months.",

        content: "Virtual memory works through a combination of hardware (MMU) and software (OS kernel). When a process accesses memory, the CPU's MMU translates virtual addresses to physical addresses using page tables. The TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) caches recent translations for speed. On a page fault, the OS handler loads the page from disk, updates the page table, and restarts the instruction. For eviction, Linux uses a modified LRU algorithm called the 'two-list strategy' with active and inactive lists.",
